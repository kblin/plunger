Installation is provided by python distutils.
Simply do

python setup.py install

as root. Alternative, you can change the default prefix by
specifying a custom --prefix, e.g.

python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

You will want to make sure that $PYTHONPATH is set accordingly.
For bash, add a line to ~/.bashrc like

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}/lib/python<version>/site-packages/

replacing <version> by the version number printed by python --version
Don't forget reloading ~/.bashrc after you're done editing it.
