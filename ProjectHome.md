plunger is a 3D mesh format converter making extensive use of plugins to support different formats.

Originally written for the WorldForge project to convert media from the Collada format to the formats used by our clients, I decided to move it to an external hosting site to invite collaboration from other people who use plunger.

The current release of plunger is the first alpha release, plunger 0.1.0
