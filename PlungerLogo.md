# Introduction #

While plunger is a text-only application for now, it would still be nice to have a logo for things like the [project's page on launchpad](https://launchpad.net/plunger).

This is implemented now.

# Details #

## Requirements ##

  * SVG or a similar vector format to allow for easy resizing
  * It should be similar to the WorldForge logo for branding reasons
  * It should be different enough to really identify plunger
  * It should be funny

## Ideas ##

  * Take the WorldForge globe and anvil, but replace the sword by a plunger.
