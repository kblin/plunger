Random Thoughts
---------------
simon	    what might be useful is added some options to do some processing on the models
simon	    e.g. scaling, rotations and translations
simon	    i'm currently doing it already in sear, but would be better not to have to do that
simon	    if you look at sear/loaders/StaticObjectFunctions.cpp  I've already implemented the kinda code you would need
simon	    the most useful part would be translating the model bacck to the origin. sometimes they have funny offsets

simon	    plunger has trouble converting this file from the media repo, 3d_objects/items/building/models/castle/curtainwall/curtain_walls.mesh.xml
